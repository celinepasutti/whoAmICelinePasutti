    <p>Coming from a small town in B.C., there was definitely not as much diversity as there is here in Edmonton.
      My nationality is Canadian. I was born in Trail, B.C.- a small refinery town tucked away in the Kootenay valley. I lived there full time until July 2021!
       My ethnic background is mostly Scandinavian/Celtic with a bit of Italian and French Canadian.
      English is my mother language, and I am taking French lessons in school- none of my parents or grandparents speak any language besides English. I'm taking French because it is a part of my background, and I find the language really fascinating.
      I also spend a lot of my time researching my Celtic background since I find paganism and it's customs (like druids), very interesting. I think it's really awesome that I come from that line of people.
