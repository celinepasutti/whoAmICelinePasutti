    <p>Since I've only been in Edmonton for a few months, my social and school life here is definitely developing.
      In my hometown, I've always had a large friend group and was home at 9pm every night before school. My graduating class was ~100 kids,
      so everyone knew everyone. Coming to such a large school with my graduating class ~500 (and the school itself has a population of 1/4 of my hometown) is extremely
      new to me. There's kind of a sense of anonymity among my peers, particularly because I'm new here and nobody really knows who I am yet. I'm trying to join as many clubs as I can while
      keeping in mind that I have 3 core classes this semester, two of them being AP.
      I have always held my grades to a high regard, achieving low to high nineties on a regular basis. One of the biggest shocks I had coming to EPS was that 80> is considered an A,, and that 50< is considered a fail. In B.C.,
      86< is an A, and 55> is a fail. Another shocker was that Social Studies and English have <i>exams</i>. For Social Studies we would mostly have to do essays or projects with the odd exam here and there about some historical event.
      As for English, I have never done an English exam and still have no idea what they could possibly test you on in that subject (spelling? the events of a story? grammar? I will find out next semester). The core subjects that have thankfully
      stayed the same are Science and Math - my favourite subjects. There's something about finally solving the answer to a difficult math problem or studying an interesting chemical reaction that will always get me excited. As for Computer Science,
      the class in B.C. was much more artistically based - we did code as well as photoshop, photography and even made games in the unity engine with our own sprites in them! I really hope we get the opportunity to do something like this in Computer Science.
      One of my biggest passions is creating a story that someone can experience for themselves, make their own choices and come up with their own conclusions.
      Some of the activities I do outside of school are:
      <ul style="font-size:1vw;">
        <li>The DND Club.</li>
          <li>Economic Citizenship Class.</li>
            <li>The Cellar.</li>
              <li>Hanging out with my new friends (hopefully I make more).</li>
                <li>And the reason Gillian and I are always late for class is because I live near the school and we go to my house for lunch.</li>
                  <li>I also play games online with my friends back at home when I get the chance to.</li>
      </ul></p>
