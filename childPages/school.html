    <p style="font-size:1.1vw;">Since I've only been in Edmonton for a few months, my social and school life here is definitely developing. I already have a few friends here! In fact, they are in the same Computer Science class as me.
      Their names are Gillian, Reem, and Rodger :) This is really big for me, after being in one friend group (for almost 9 years), it's not only really upsetting to leave my friends in B.C. behind, but it's also really
      hard to make new friends since I've never really had to do that before.
      In my hometown, I've always had a large friend group and was home at 9pm every night before school. My graduating class was ~100 kids,
      so everyone knew everyone. Coming to such a large school with my graduating class ~500 (and the school itself has a population of 1/4 of my hometown) is extremely
      new to me. There's kind of a sense of anonymity among my peers, particularly because I'm new here and nobody really knows who I am yet. I'm trying to join as many clubs as I can while
      keeping in mind that I have 3 core classes this semester, two of them being AP.
      I have always held my grades to a high regard, achieving low to high nineties on a regular basis. One of the biggest shocks I had coming to EPS was that 80> is considered an A,, and that 50< is considered a fail. In B.C.,
      86< is an A, and 55> is a fail. Another shocker was that Social Studies and English have <i>exams</i>. For Social Studies we would mostly have to do essays or projects with the odd exam here and there about some historical event.
      As for English, I have never done an English exam and still have no idea what they could possibly test you on in that subject (spelling? the events of a story? grammar? I will find out next semester). The core subjects that have thankfully
      stayed the same are Science and Math - my favourite subjects. There's something about finally solving the answer to a difficult math problem or studying an interesting chemical reaction that will always get me excited. As for Computer Science,
      the class in B.C. was much more artistically based - we did code as well as photoshop, photography and even made games in the unity engine with our own sprites in them! I really hope we get the opportunity to do something like this in Computer Science.
      One of my biggest passions is creating a story that someone can experience for themselves, make their own choices and come up with their own conclusions.
      Some of the activities I do outside of school are:</p>
      <ul style="font-size:1vw;">
        <li>The DND Club.</li>
          <li>Economic Citizenship Class.</li>
            <li>The Cellar.</li>
              <li>Hanging out with my new friends (hopefully I make more).</li>
                <li>And the reason Gillian and I are always late for class is because I live near the school and we go to my house for lunch.</li>
                  <li>I also play games online with my friends back at home when I get the chance to.</li>
      </ul>
