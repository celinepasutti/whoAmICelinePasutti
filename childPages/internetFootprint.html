    <div class="mainunesco"><p style="font-size:1.15vw">From a young age, I've always been taught that the way you present yourself online is super important.
      I have always tried to maintain a positive view of myself online and I think I've done a pretty good job at this (compared to others I know).
      I make videos sometimes on TikTok, YouTube and Twitch. I don't really want to become famous or anything, but it's just fun to hang out with friends
      and maybe even meet new people. The only thing that really comes up when I search my name is some mother-son wedding song(?) and news articles about myself when I was younger.
      When I lived in Trail and visited my dad in Vernon, there was never really any stories in such a small, uneventful place. I got on the Vernon Morning Star paper once when I was four
      because I was feeding some seagulls french fries on Kin Beach, and another time on the Trail Daily Times when I was playing with my childhood friend at the local park.
      I think it would be cool if one day I could establish myself more online, but for now there isn't really much out there about me.</p>
