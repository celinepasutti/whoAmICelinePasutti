<p style="font-size:1.07465vw;">To be honest, I don't 100% know what I'm going to do for a living. I would like to go into computer science at NAIT, maybe in cybersecurity
  or game design? Then I would like to work in that field for a long while, before getting a degree in teaching so that I can become a
  teacher in computer science so that I can retire with a teacher's pension (and have summer with little work to do as well as interaction with students).
  I would honestly really love to be involved in game design, but the field is a very risky and luck-based one so it's unfortunately not a very safe route to go.
  Another thing I would love to do some day is stream or make content online. But once again, very very risky industry so not a good idea.
  I have a long time to figure out what exactly I want to do, but I know for sure I want to work with computers and code.
